[Learn to Unlearn: Insights into Machine Unlearing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07512): 

> The pioneering study in the domain of machine unlearning was conducted by Cao et al., marking the initial introduction of this concept. Their research entailed the proposal of a heuristic methodology that allowed for the transformation of an ML algorithm into a summation format, effectively neutralizing the influence of data lineage. 
> 
> The non-uniform distribution of unlearning requests in practical applications was also considered within their study. 
> 
> However, it merits acknowledgment that not every ML algorithm can undergo conversion into the summation format, and the data lineage varying in granularity levels might not always be addressed.
